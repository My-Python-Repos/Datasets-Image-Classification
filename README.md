# Repo of Datasets for Images

### CNN_Dataset_for_Image_Classification" 

Because convolutional neural networks work so well with images, to learn more about them, we're going to start with a dataset of images.

The images we're going to work with are from the [Food-101 dataset](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/), a collection of 101 different categories of 101,000 (1000 images per category) real-world images of food dishes. 

To begin, we're only going to use two of the categories, pizza üçï and steak ü•© and build a binary classifier.
